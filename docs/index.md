This tutorial provides the basic working concept of **IGMAS+** when used to investigate gravity and magnetic fields, including all aspects that need to be considered when starting an **IGMAS+** project.

The tutorial is intended to bridge general textbook knowledge on gravity modelling with the specific “how-to” information given in the [IGMAS+ User Manual](https://igmas.git-pages.gfz-potsdam.de/igmas-pages/files/IGMAS_User_Manual.pdf) .
Hence, it provides both key words from the gravity research field (without repeating textbook contents) and definitions for **IGMAS+** specific terms (to be further looked up in the manual).
